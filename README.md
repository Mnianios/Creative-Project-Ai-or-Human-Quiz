This is my Creative Project for the Honors Course: Mediated Lives.
I developed an interactive Web Quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The application presents users with pairs of AI-generated and human-created artworks, allowing them to select their preferred images without revealing the origins until the quiz concludes.

Features:
Created an interactive web interface for user interaction.
Implemented question progression, user-choice tracking and result calculation.
Developed a mechanism to track user preferences, calculate AI bias percentages and present the results.
Integrated AI-generated images from tools like MidJourney and custom human-made artwork.
